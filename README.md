PLOT THE DOTS
A Dot Plot is a representation consisting of data points plotted on a fairly simple scale, typically using filled in circles. 
implement the Dot Plot module using the global variables given below-
divisions=0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12
Use this variable to create number line. Value of divisions are separated by  “|”, these divisions must be present on the number line and has to be separated equally. 
 
answerDots=6|2|3|5|2|5|0|0|2|10|7|4|1
Value of answerDots is the correct value that comes on Dot Plot for each division.
 
axisName =”Minutes to eat breakfast”.
